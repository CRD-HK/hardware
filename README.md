# SBC Project (CRD-HK/HKU)

The Single Board Computer (SBCs) project was established in 2019 by the CRD-HK (the CRD-Hk Charity) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to enable scientists and research institutions to gather autonomous environmental data (ED) at Hong Kong sites.

The role of the CRD-HK team is to design and select SBC units that are retrofitted with a range of sophisticated sensors. To this date, there are no other universities present that either are developing or have completed the type of project.  

 

Major ED recordings of relevance to any scientific research are the measurements of; 

(1) pH.
(2) Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP)
(3) Dissolved oxygen (DO). 
(4) Conductivity and/or turbidity.
(5) Windspeed.
(6) Temperature, ambient air, and water.

In the SBC project, the team has set the bar high by utilizing extensive coding with novel components. The major ED recordings have been expanded with:


(7) Air Quality Sensor.
(8) UV Sensor.
(9) LoRaWAN module.
(10)Combined Humidity, Temperature & Pressure Sensor.
(11)Tilt Angle.
(12)Ultrasonic Sensor (5 meters range).
(13)Flex Solar Panel.

Both coding and circuitry designs are deposited here throughout the project cycle.
